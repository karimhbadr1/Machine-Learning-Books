Starting to learn Machine Learning by going through different books

I've decided to start learning about machine learning!
I've been suggested and seen great books out there and decided to start going through them.

The first book I'm going to try going through is:

<b>Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow</b>
